# Secrets

# This is an application that allows users to store, update, and view secrets that they have posted. 
# While the user can only see one secret at a time, it is intended to demonstrate authentication skills of various types
# i.e. password encryption using hashing and salting, along with Google's OAuth2 API

# This also demonstrates how to provide entries and updates to a relational database (postgreSQL), error handling, route handling, and other skills needed
# for proper website flow.
